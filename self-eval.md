# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

**It's hard at first because I feel lost when I don't know what I don't know. A broad perspective will only with time and practice. Then, hunting down answers will become more efficient.**

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

**I could do better at taking breaks. It looks like an actuall timer will be necessary. I forget to move often enough.**

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

**The people around me are valueable resources. I don't have to find all the answers myself. Also, helping someone else with their questions deepens my own understanding.**
